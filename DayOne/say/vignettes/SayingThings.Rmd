## Background

This document describes the package `say`, which is currently still in alpha, and exposes a single function that says hello:

```{r setup}
library(say)
say_hello()
```

We have included basic example data to allow for demonstration and testing:

```{r data}
data(corenames)
corenames
say_hello(corenames[, 1], punc = "!\n")
```

## Next steps

Our team is currently working the second phase of the project, which will allow users to say good bye. 

## Setup

```{r config}
sessionInfo()
```
